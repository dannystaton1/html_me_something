    <p>DJing and turntablism, MCing/rapping, breakdancing, graffiti art and beatboxing
    are the creative outlets that collectively make up hip hop culture and its revolutionary 
    aesthetic. Like the blues, these arts were developed by African American communities to 
    enable people to make a statement, whether political or emotional and participate in 
    community activities. These practices spread globally around the 1980s as fans could "make
    it their own" and express themselves in new and creative ways in music, dance and other arts.</p>

    <h2>Djing</h2>
    <p>DJing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and 
    beats using two or more phonograph turntables (or other sound sources, such as tapes, CDs 
    or digital audio files) and a DJ mixer that is plugged into a PA system.[89] One of the 
    first few hip hop DJs was Kool DJ Herc, who created hip hop in the 1970s through the isolation
    and extending of "breaks" (the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat). 
    In addition to developing Herc's techniques, DJs Grandmaster Flowers, Grandmaster Flash,
    Grand Wizzard Theodore, and Grandmaster Caz made further innovations with the introduction 
    of "scratching", which has become one of the key sounds associated with hip hop music.</p>
