    <p>DJing and turntablism, MCing/rapping, breakdancing, graffiti art and beatboxing
    are the creative outlets that collectively make up hip hop culture and its revolutionary 
    aesthetic. Like the blues, these arts were developed by African American communities to 
    enable people to make a statement, whether political or emotional and participate in 
    community activities. These practices spread globally around the 1980s as fans could "make
    it their own" and express themselves in new and creative ways in music, dance and other arts.</p>

    <h2>Djing</h2>
    <p>DJing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and 
    beats using two or more phonograph turntables (or other sound sources, such as tapes, CDs 
    or digital audio files) and a DJ mixer that is plugged into a PA system.[89] One of the 
    first few hip hop DJs was Kool DJ Herc, who created hip hop in the 1970s through the isolation
    and extending of "breaks" (the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat). 
    In addition to developing Herc's techniques, DJs Grandmaster Flowers, Grandmaster Flash,
    Grand Wizzard Theodore, and Grandmaster Caz made further innovations with the introduction 
    of "scratching", which has become one of the key sounds associated with hip hop music.</p>
    
    <h2>Emceeing</h2>
    <p>Rapping (also known as emceeing,MCing,spitting (bars),or just rhymingrefers to "spoken or 
    chanted rhyming lyrics with a strong rhythmic accompaniment".[94] Rapping typically features 
    complex wordplay, rapid delivery, and a range of "street slang", some of which is unique to 
    the hip hop subculture. While rapping is often done over beats, either done by a DJ, a beatboxer, 
    it can also be done without accompaniment. It can be broken down into different components, 
    such as "content", "flow" (rhythm and rhyme), and "delivery".[95] Rapping is distinct from spoken 
    word poetry in that it is performed in time to the beat of the music.[96][97][98] The use of 
    the word "rap" to describe quick and slangy speech or witty repartee long predates the musical 
    form.[99] MCing is a form of expression that is embedded within ancient African culture and oral 
    tradition as throughout history verbal acrobatics or jousting involving rhymes were common 
    within the Afro-American community.</p>

    <h2> Graffiti</h2>
    <p>Graffiti is the most controversial of hip hop's elements, as a number of the most notable 
    graffiti pioneers say that they do not consider graffiti to be an element of hip hop, including 
    Lady Pink, Seen, Blade, Fargo, Cholly Rock, Fuzz One, and Coco 144.[101][102][103] Lady Pink says,
     "I donâ€™t think graffiti is hip hop. Frankly I grew up with disco music. There's a long background 
     of graffiti as an entity unto itself,"[104][105] and Fargo says, "There is no correlation between 
     hip hop and graffiti, one has nothing to do with the other."[101][103][106] Hip hop pioneer Grandmaster 
     Flash has also questioned the connection between hip hop and graffiti, saying, "You know what bugs 
     me, they put hip hop with graffiti. How do they intertwine?".</p>
